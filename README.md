# Dagger Query

A graph based query language on top of [dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger)

Dagger Query can be used to investigate the dagger dependency graph.

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**


## How to use Dagger Query?

1. Add `//src/com/google/daggerquery:dagger_query_plugin` target in a **plugins** attribute of your app's target.
2. Use **dagger_query** rule located in a `src/com/google/daggerquery/executor` with your app's target name. 

       dagger_query(
          name = "dagger_query_app",

          # Put here the name of a target in which you have used a plugin for generating binding graph.
          dagger_app_target = "YOUR_TARGET"
       )

3. If you use Linux or OSX you can execute bash script `dagger-query.sh` located in a `project` folder for executing queries! ðŸš€ Pass a path to the `dagger_query` target as the first parameter.  
    > ./dagger-query.sh YOUR_PATH deps com.google.Cat \
    > ./dagger-query.sh YOUR_PATH allpaths com.google.Office com.google.Beach \
    > ./dagger-query.sh YOUR_PATH somepath com.google.Paris com.google.sights.EiffelTower
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    If you use Windows, consider running the command-line app manually.
    
## How to use Dagger Query UI?

1. Add `//src/com/google/daggerquery:dagger_query_plugin` target in a **plugins** attribute of your app's target.
2. Use **dagger_query_server** rule located in a `src/com/google/daggerquery/server` with your app's target name. 

       dagger_query_server(
          name = "dagger_query_ui_server",

          # Put here the name of a target in which you have used a plugin for generating binding graph.
          dagger_app_target = "YOUR_TARGET"
       )

3. If you use Linux or OSX you can execute bash script `dagger-query-ui.sh` located in a `project` folder for starting a server and opening a website! ðŸ‘¾ Pass a path to the `dagger_query_server` target as the parameter.  
    > ./dagger-query-ui.sh YOUR_PATH
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
   If you use Windows, consider starting the server manually.
                                                                                                                                                                                                             

If the website does not open, you need to start it manually by clicking on the file `src/com/daggerqueryui/index.html`.

## Dagger Query UI: Getting started

### Using an example project
If you launch `dagger-query-ui.sh` script without any parameters it will use example target by default. It will open a website where you can specify queries in the input field.
```
cd project
./dagger-query-ui.sh
```
### Executing queries

> allpaths com.google.daggerquery.example.HotelComponent com.google.daggerquery.example.models.Phone

![allpaths](https://github.com/googleinterns/dagger-query/blob/master/project/assets/allpaths_query_example.png)

> somepath com.google.daggerquery.example.BeachComponent com.google.daggerquery.example.models.Tourist

![somepath](https://github.com/googleinterns/dagger-query/blob/master/project/assets/somepath_query_example.png)

> deps com.google.daggerquery.example.models.Villa 

![deps](https://github.com/googleinterns/dagger-query/blob/master/project/assets/deps_query_example.png)

> rdeps com.google.daggerquery.example.models.Tourist 

![rdeps](https://github.com/googleinterns/dagger-query/blob/master/project/assets/rdeps_query_example.png)

### Traversing an arbitrary graph

* Enter a node name in the input field and it will appear on the canvas if such a node exists on the graph.
* Use **left-click** on a node to show all its dependencies and hide them.
* Use **right-click** on a node to show all its ancestors and hide them.
