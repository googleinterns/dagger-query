# Dagger Query

A graph based query language on top of [dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger)

Dagger Query can be used to investigate the dagger dependency graph.


## How to use Dagger Query project?

1. Add `//src/com/google/daggerquery:dagger_query_plugin` target in a **plugins** attribute of your app's target.
2. Use **dagger_query** rule located in a `src/com/google/daggerquery/executor` with your app's target name. 

       dagger_query(
          name = "dagger_query_app",

          # Put here the name of a target in which you have used a plugin for generating binding graph.
          dagger_app_target = "YOUR_TARGET"
       )

3. Use bash script located in a `project` folder for executing queries! ðŸš€ Pass a path to the `dagger_query` target as the first parameter.  
    > ./dagger-query.sh YOUR_PATH deps com.google.Cat \
    > ./dagger-query.sh YOUR_PATH allpaths com.google.Office com.google.Beach \
    > ./dagger-query.sh YOUR_PATH somepath com.google.Paris com.google.sights.EiffelTower
