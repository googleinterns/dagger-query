## How to use Dagger Query project?

1. Add `//src/com/google/daggerquery:dagger_query_plugin` target in a **plugins** attribute of your app's target.
2. Go to `src/com/google/daggerquery/BUILD` and use **dagger_query_textproto** rule with your app's target name. 

       dagger_query_textproto(
          name = "binding_graph_data",

          # Put here the name of a target in which you have used a plugin for generating binding graph.
          dagger_app_target = "YOUR_TARGET"
       )

3. Use bash script located in a `project` folder for executing queries! ðŸš€ 
    > ./dagger-query.sh deps com.google.Cat \
    > ./dagger-query.sh allpaths com.google.Office com.google.Beach \
    > ./dagger-query.sh somepath com.google.Paris com.google.sights.EiffelTower
